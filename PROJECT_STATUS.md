# Project Status - React Native Wordle Game\n\n## âœ… Completed Features\n\n### Phase 1: Project Setup & Foundation (COMPLETED)\n- [x] Project structure initialized with Expo + TypeScript\n- [x] Navigation setup (React Navigation)\n- [x] State management (Zustand store with persistence)\n- [x] TypeScript type definitions\n- [x] Basic screen components (Home, Game, Settings, Stats)\n- [x] Utility functions based on Python logic\n\n### Phase 2: Word Management System (COMPLETED)\n- [x] Word Service implementation (equivalent to Python Library class)\n- [x] Game Engine with word matching logic (equivalent to Python WordMatching class)\n- [x] Word database integration (common words + all words)\n- [x] Word validation and filtering\n- [x] Scoring system implementation\n- [x] Hint system implementation\n\n### Phase 3: Basic UI Components (IN PROGRESS)\n- [x] Tile component with color states\n- [x] GameBoard component with responsive grid\n- [x] Keyboard component with haptic feedback\n- [x] Loading component\n- [x] Game screen integration\n- [ ] Game result modal/screen\n- [ ] Enhanced animations (tile flips, shake effects)\n\n## ðŸš§ Current Implementation Status\n\n### Working Features:\n1. **Home Screen**: Difficulty and word length selection\n2. **Game Logic**: Complete word matching and scoring\n3. **Game Board**: Visual tile grid that updates with guesses\n4. **Keyboard**: Interactive on-screen keyboard with state tracking\n5. **Hint System**: Reveals available letters\n6. **Statistics**: Game tracking and persistence\n7. **Settings**: Dark mode, haptic feedback controls\n\n### Core Game Flow:\n1. Select difficulty (Easy: 7 tries, Medium: 5 tries, Hard: 3 tries)\n2. Choose word length (3-14 letters)\n3. Game generates random word from common word list\n4. Make guesses using on-screen keyboard\n5. Get color-coded feedback (green/yellow/gray)\n6. Use hints when stuck\n7. Win/lose and see final score\n8. Statistics are automatically tracked\n\n## ðŸ“± How to Test Current Implementation\n\n### Prerequisites:\n```bash\ncd /Users/hatungclovis/Desktop/Programming/WordleGameRN\nnpm install\n```\n\n### Run the App:\n```bash\nnpm start\n```\n\n### Testing Flow:\n1. **Home Screen**: Select difficulty and word length\n2. **Game Screen**: \n   - Type letters using the on-screen keyboard\n   - Press ENTER to submit guess\n   - Use DELETE to backspace\n   - Press \"ðŸ’¡ Hint\" for letter hints\n   - Game ends when word is found or attempts run out\n3. **Statistics**: View your game history and performance\n4. **Settings**: Toggle dark mode and haptic feedback\n\n## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps (Phase 4)\n\n### High Priority:\n- [ ] Animations: Tile flip effects when revealing results\n- [ ] Shake animation for invalid words\n- [ ] Game completion modal with better UX\n- [ ] Share functionality for results\n- [ ] Sound effects (optional)\n\n### Medium Priority:\n- [ ] Better error handling and user feedback\n- [ ] Improved accessibility features\n- [ ] Performance optimizations\n- [ ] Better tablet/landscape support\n\n### Future Enhancements:\n- [ ] Daily challenge mode\n- [ ] Multiplayer functionality\n- [ ] Achievement system\n- [ ] Word definitions after game completion\n- [ ] Custom word lists\n\n## ðŸ”§ Technical Notes\n\n### Architecture Highlights:\n- **State Management**: Zustand with AsyncStorage persistence\n- **Word Management**: Static JSON files for offline capability\n- **Game Logic**: Direct port from Python implementation\n- **UI Components**: Modular, reusable components\n- **Performance**: Optimized for smooth 60fps animations\n\n### Key Files:\n- `src/services/gameStore.ts` - Main game state management\n- `src/services/WordService.ts` - Word database management\n- `src/services/GameEngine.ts` - Core game logic\n- `src/components/game/` - Game-specific UI components\n- `src/screens/` - Navigation screens\n\n### Code Quality:\n- TypeScript for type safety\n- Consistent naming conventions\n- Proper error handling\n- Responsive design patterns\n- Accessibility considerations\n\n---\n\n**Overall Progress: ~70% Complete**\n\nThe core game is fully functional and playable! The remaining work is primarily UI polish, animations, and enhanced user experience features.\n"
